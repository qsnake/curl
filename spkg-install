# This is absolutely crucial. Qsnake has $RM="rm", and if that is so, then the
# configure script below keeps it as RM="rm" and the make fails later on. In
# Ubuntu, $RM is not defined, then the configure script below sets RM="rm -f"
# and the make succeeds. So to fix this, we need to unset RM, and then all is
# fine.
